        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chickpeas – Chickpeas are the star here. They add fiber, texture and make the curry a filling, protein packed meal. I wouldn’t recommend substituting this since it’s the base. Also make sure to drain and rinse them.</li>
            <li>Tomatoes, Onion and Garlic – These veggies are the base of your curry and really add a depth of flavor. If you don’t like tomatoes, you won’t distinctly taste them. However, you can substitute the tomatoes with pumpkin puree, a butternut squash puree or something of the sort. The curry won’t taste exactly the same, but it will give it that beautiful creamy texture!</li>
            <li>Coconut Milk – Coconut milk adds the creaminess to this curry and is what makes the sauce so smooth. I recommend using full fat canned coconut milk.</li>
            <li>Coconut Flour – This is optional, but it will thicken up the curry a little bit. You can also use regular flour.</li>
            <li>Coconut Oil – The oil is for sautéing the onions and tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Garam Masala – This is the main seasoning blend in this recipe! If you can’t find it, you can make your own. </li>
            <li>Additional Seasonings – These extra seasonings (sea salt, ground black pepper, curry powder, cumin and garlic) are simple and compliment the Garam Masala. </li>
            <li>Lime – Ah yes, our other star ingredient! Lime juice adds a subtle citrus note that brings everything together in such a delightful way. Don’t skip it! </li>


        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the Oil: In a deep pot over medium-high heat, add the coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Add in the Onions and Tomatoes: Grind some sea salt and ground black pepper over the mixture and stir together. Lower heat to medium and allow to cook down until juices of the tomatoes are naturally released and onions are soft, about 10 minutes. I’ve found that this step really helps to develop the flavors of the dish and break them all down for the seasonings later.</li>
            <li>Add in the Chickpeas: Also mix in the garlic, garam masala, curry powder and cumin. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add in the Coconut Milk and Stir Again: Add in the coconut flour (or any flour, optional) which helps to slightly thicken the curry. Bring the curry to a boil, and then reduce to medium-low so that the mixture continues to simmer for 10 to 12 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve and Enjoy: Taste the curry and season with salt and pepper if you desire. Remove the curry from the heat and squeeze a lime lightly over the top of the curry, stirring to combine. Don’t skip this step!! Allow to cool slightly and then serve. Enjoy!</li>
